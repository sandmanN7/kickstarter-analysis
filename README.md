# Challenge 1 Kickstarter Analysis Overview and Summary
## Overview of Project
The objective of this project was to see how different fundraising campaigns did with regards to when they began and the amount they wanted to raise by using various simple and effective tools in Microsoft Excel.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis
The fundraisers were broken down by when they started and by their goal amounts. In both their starting times and their goal amounts, each was broken down by the number of successful, failed and canceled; with the dates started being divided into monthly sections and the goal amounts being divided into ranges based on the fundraising goal.
### Challenges
The only challenge I found was attempting to build an easy formula for counting the number of successful, failed and canceled fundraisers. It was a bit challenging on the later part of the formula, and I speculate that there are perhaps more efficient ways of completing it. I ended up being able to use the provided documentation for the "countifs" function and used that to make my formula more organized and ultimately, the graph information came out about how it should have.
## Results
### Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date
Generally, fundraisers were most likely to succeed when the started in May, followed closely by June, with each concurrent month, before and after respectively, having a decreasing likelihood of success. With this data, the inverse also appears to be true, the likelihood a fundraiser is most likely to fail is when it is started in December, followed by January.
### Outcomes Based on Goals
In terms of fundraising, the less the goal was, the higher the likelihood of the fundraiser succeeding. However, there was an exception happened for fundraiser goals between $35,000 and $45,000, though given the small number of these, these probably are outliers.
### Limitations and Recommendations
#### Limitations
The main limitation of this set of data is that while there are a large number of countries represented, there is not any meaningful demographic information beyond this. We do not know if these were school/ educational or community fundraisers, the backgrounds of individuals who did donate, and perhaps typical donation amounts (not average). Knowing further pieces of information such as these could help further the likelihood of a successful fundraiser.
#### Recomendations
I think that both sections would benefit from a stacked column chart; in this way, it would better illustrate the success-to-failure ratio of fundraisers both by launch date and goal amounts.
